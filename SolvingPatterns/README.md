## Frequency Counter
This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values which is usually o(n) time. This can avoid the need of nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays or strings.

## Multiple Pointer
This pattern creates pointers or value that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end, middle based on a certian condition. It's very efficient in solving problem with minimal space complexity as well.
