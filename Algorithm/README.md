# Linear Search
Process of searching through an array, moving from one item from another, beginning from the start and moving towards the end or vice versa.

# Binary Search
This is a more faster form of searching, and it works on only sorted arrays. Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time.

# Naive string Search
This involves searching for a larger string in a sub-string

# burble sort
it places the larger value into sorted position

# selection sort
similar to burble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position
