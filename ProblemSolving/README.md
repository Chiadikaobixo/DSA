## Frequency Counter
This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values which is usually o(n) time. This can avoid the need of nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays or strings.

## Multiple Pointer
This pattern creates pointers or value that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end, middle based on a certian condition. It's very efficient in solving problem with minimal space complexity as well. 

## Sliding Window
This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created). Its is very usefull in keeping track of a subset of data in an array or string e.t.c
